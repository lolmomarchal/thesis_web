## Abstract

Computational pathology has emerged as a rapidly advancing subspecialty focused on the quantitative, large-scale analysis of pathological data like Whole Slide Images (WSIs). This work addresses significant challenges in preprocessing and model interpretability within this field. The core contributions are twofold: first, the development of SlideLab, a novel and robust preprocessing module designed to optimize the creation of high-quality WSI datasets; second, the introduction of a new interpretability method, Polarized Attentional Confidence (PAC), to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of AI systems in pathology.

## Project Highlights

### Project Analysis üß†

This thesis effectively tackles two of the most significant hurdles in computational pathology: the lack of standardized preprocessing and the interpretability of "black box" AI models. The project is logically divided into two main contributions:

  * **SlideLab (The Preprocessing Framework):** A modular and comprehensive solution to the rigid and irreproducible nature of existing tools. It addresses key WSI challenges like computational cost, stain variability, and artifacts through a sophisticated, GPU-accelerated architecture.
  * **Polarized Attentional Confidence (PAC) (The Interpretability Method):** An intelligent approach to address clinical trust in AI. By combining a model's attention (importance) and probability (confidence), PAC creates a robust metric to validate that models are learning biologically relevant features.

### Key Achievements üèÜ

  * **Development of a Novel and Complete Tool:** Built a functional, end-to-end software pipeline, SlideLab.
  * **Superior Performance Through Benchmarking:** Rigorously tested SlideLab against five other state-of-the-art pipelines, achieving the highest Dice score (0.741) for tissue segmentation.
  * **Improved Downstream Model Performance:** Demonstrated that better preprocessing leads to better science, as the model trained on SlideLab-processed data outperformed others.
  * **Innovation in Model Interpretability:** Proposed PAC as a new method tailored to the specific challenges of multi-instance learning in pathology.
  * **Validation with Real-World Case Studies:** Successfully applied PAC to clinically relevant problems in colorectal cancer and leukemia.

### Summary of Results üìä

  * **SlideLab is Quantifiably Better:** The framework produces higher-quality data, evidenced by superior Dice scores and improved downstream model performance.
  * **PAC Provides Deeper Biological Insight:** Case studies in MSI and B-ALL demonstrated that PAC can validate a model's reasoning by correctly identifying biologically and clinically relevant features.

## Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lolmomarchal/SlideLab.git
cd SlideLab
```

To install the required dependencies, create and activate the Conda environment using the provided file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate slidelab
```

## Usage

Below is an example command to run the full preprocessing pipeline on a directory of slides:

```bash
python SlidePreprocessing.py -i /path/to/input/ -o /path/to/output/ \
  -s 512 -m 40 --remove_blurry_tiles --normalize_staining --encode \
  -th 0.8 -bh 0.02 --device cuda --batch_size 256
```

## Arguments

The pipeline's behavior can be customized with various arguments. Here are some of the most common ones:

| Argument                        | Description                                      | Default       |

| `-o`, `--output_path`           | Path to save the output tiles                    | **Required**  |
| `-s`, `--desired_size`          | Desired size of tiles in pixels                  | `256`         |

| `-ov`, `--overlap`              | Factor of overlap between tiles (1 = no overlap) | `1`           |
| `-rb`, `--remove_blurry_tiles`  | Remove blurry tiles using a Laplacian filter     | `False`       |
| `-n`, `--normalize_staining`    | Normalize the staining of the tiles              | `False`       |
| `-e`, `--encode`                | Encode tiles into a `.h5` file for deep learning | `False`       |
| `-th`, `--tissue_threshold`     | Minimum tissue content to consider a tile valid  | `0.7`         |
